## The Problem

- As demand increases for fuel efficient cars, automobile designers need to know how to meet this demand without sacrificing other features, such as performance, luxury, cargo space, etc.

- Therefore, one needs to know what factors contribute to fuel efficiency, and quantify their impact.

--- 

## The Model

- A linear model was built to make the predictions, which identifies weight, horspower, number of cylinders, and transmission type as the most important factors in determining fuel economy.

$$MPG_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 transmission_i + \beta_2 weight_i + \beta_3 cylinders_i + \beta_4 horsepower_i + e_i$$

- Coefficients (betas)

```{r echo=FALSE}
data(mtcars)

# change transmission and cyl variables to factors and relabel
mtcars$am <- factor(mtcars$am)
mtcars$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
levels(mtcars$am) <- c('automatic', 'manual')

# fit a linear model to predict mpg
fit <- lm(mpg ~ am + wt + cyl + hp, data=mtcars)

fit$coefficients
```

- R-squared

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(fit)$r.squared
```

## Why Use This App?

- This model is cumbersome for a designer to use when comparing possible design parameters for a new car.

- MPG prediction calcluation for an automatic, 3,325 lb. car, with 4 cylinders, and 123 hp
$$\hat{MPG} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (0) + \beta_2 (3.325) + \beta_3 (0) + \beta_4 (0) + \beta_5 (123)$$
```{r}
mpg_hat <- fit$coeff[1] + fit$coeff[2] * 0 + fit$coeff[3] * 3.325 + fit$coeff[4] * 0 + fit$coeff[5] * 0 + fit$coeff[6] * 123
mpg_hat
```

- Rather, it would be nice if these predictions could be made quickly with an intuitive graphical user interface and a measure of uncertainty.

- The Shiny App does just this.
